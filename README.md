# Instacart_Basket_Analysis_Python
 Acting as an analyst for Instacart I used Python to wrangle and analyze several datasets. I then created a report that communicates my analysis process and my results and recommendations to key business questions from Instacart.

# Objective

![image](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRkijGRQdnHQzJAr9372tcuSZxPAQwZjM3XbA&s)

Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. 

# Key Questions

● The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.

● They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.

● Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.

● Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.

● The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. For example:

  ○ What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to Instacart)?
  
  ○ Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
  
  ○ Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
  
  ○ Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering
    habits?
    
  ○ What different classifications does the demographic information suggest?
    Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?
    
  ○ What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer
    profiles? Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products customers are ordering, and anything else you can think of.

# Data Source

This project utilizes open-source datasets from Instacart

[Instacart Dataset](www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017)

# Tools

The data was analyzed using Python and the following libraries:

● Pandas: for data manipulation and analysis

● Numpy: for mathematical operations

● Seaborn: for data visualizations based of Matplotlib

● Matplotlib: for data visualizations

● SciPy: for numerical, scientific, and technical computing

# Folders

● 01 Project Management: Project Brief & Data Dictionary.

● 02 Data: Data folder not uploaded to GitHub due to size.  Separated into two subfolders Original and Prepared Data. These folders contain the original data sets and the data sets
after they have been cleaned and prepared for analysis. 

● 03 Scripts: The Jupyter notebooks containing the Python coding for the analysis.

● 04 Analysis: Separated into three subfolders Reports, Test Files, and Visualizations. The Reports subfolder contains crosstabs report and the Visualizations subfolder contains
the visualizations used for developing and explaining insights.  Test Files folder was not needed for this analysis.

● 05 Sent to Client: The final Excel report sent to client.

# Resources

Note:  Instacart is a real company that’s made their data available online. However, the contents of the attached project brief have been fabricated by CareerFoundry for the purpose
of this analysis.
